### Git and quality rules

- Use conventional commits for clarity (feat, fix, docs, refactor, chore).
- Keep PRs small and focused; include summary and screenshots for UI changes.
- Ensure `npm run build` and lint pass locally before pushing.
- For schema changes, run migrations and document impact in PR description.
- Protect `master` with PRs; avoid direct pushes when collaborating.
