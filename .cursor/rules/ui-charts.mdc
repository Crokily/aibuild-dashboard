### UI and charts rules

- Server fetch, client render: fetch product and daily records in Server Components, pass to a Client chart component.
- Charts live in a Client Component (e.g., `components/ProductChart.tsx`) and use Recharts (`LineChart`, `Line`, `XAxis`, `YAxis`, `Tooltip`).
- Lines to include: `closingInventory`, `procurementAmount` (qty * price), `salesAmount` (qty * price).
- Use dates on the X axis and numerical values on Y.
- Provide loading and error UI for upload and dashboard interactions.
